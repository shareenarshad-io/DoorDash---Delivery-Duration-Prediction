# DoorDash---Delivery-Duration-Prediction
Doordash Data Science Project 

When a consumer places an order on DoorDash, we show the expected time of delivery. It is very important for DoorDash to get this right, as it has a big impact on consumer experience. In this exercise, you will build a model to predict the estimated time taken for a delivery.

Concretely, for a given delivery you must predict the total delivery duration seconds , i.e., the time taken from

Start: the time consumer submits the order (created_at) to
End: when the order will be delivered to the consumer (actual_delivery_time)

This project aims to answer these questions above.
